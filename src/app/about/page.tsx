                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                  My name is Adam Issac, and I am a boy who is a senior at Denmark High School. Indeed, it is over the years, 
                  into my second year in high school, that I have come to realize the actual weight of the importance of assisted 
                  private learning. Most students have trouble following the lectures delivered by teachers, including me. And then, 
                  most times, we don't feel like studying, and the material available is so complex that it becomes impossible for 
                  us to understand, and we keep on being in that loop of confusion.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                  I have always loved and enjoyed the subject of math since it was a subject that made sense to me and could be 
                  easily explained by others when I was confused about a certain topic. It is me who created Adam's Alphabet, 
                  for I am the one with the problem in school. Throughout my education, I was always caring, which means that 
                  I was there to aid anyone who couldn't or struggled with learning new topics. I am very adaptive, so I can 
                  work with anyone if need be, and you can be at peace with yourself that the work will be done well before the 
                  submission date.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                  Most accurate information on me: I always have a flair for math when it comes to studies, which boosted my 
                  confidence to develop the program since my friends would always come to me when having math questions. They 
                  would call me their "math tutor." Instead of suppressing my love/enjoyment for math and teaching it, I decided 
                  to help others who struggle with math. So, I started tutoring two of my family friend's kids who were in 6th 
                  and 8th grade. As I taught them, I found out how interesting and enjoyable I found this position.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-6 text-lg">
                  The students I was teaching were always very thankful for the experience since they understood my simplified 
                  version. The students soon started to do better in school, and they gave credit to my classes. It then dawned 
                  on me how valuable teaching is, and I strove to help more students on a larger scale. As I started to research, 
                  I realized most students who are below average in school are often in financial distress at home, which I could 
                  understand since the two students I taught before came from a low-income background. That is why I made this 
                  program accessibleâ€”to tutor students with the types of challenges that I had.
                </p>

                  Even though the website is not complete yet, I am making humongous efforts toward its completion. Decoding Adam's 
                  Alphabet is my initiative to make sure that every single student has learning resources they can understand and 
                  reach complete success with. By providing the services free of charge, I hope it will try to take out some of 
                  the financial pressures from families and afford every learner a very conducive environment accessible from any 
                  threat so that at the end of it all, students can acquire the knowledge and confidence needed for the take-off 
                  of their studies.
